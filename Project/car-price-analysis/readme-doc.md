## Code Structure and Design Decisions

### AI Chat System
```python
class QASystem:
    # Optimized for EC2 free tier

- Optimized chunk sizes for EC2 resources

### Price Prediction
```python
class CarPricePredictor:
    def __init__(self, models=None, fast_mode=True):
        # Fast mode default for EC2 compatibility
        # Selective model initialization
```

**Key Decisions:**
- Implemented early stopping for efficient training
- Used parallel processing with resource limits
- Added feature importance caching
- Optimized model selection for performance

### Main Application
```python
class CombinedCarApp:
    def __init__(self):
        # Modular initialization
        # Resource-aware component loading
```

**Key Decisions:**
- Modular design for maintainability
- Dynamic resource allocation
- Efficient state management
- Optimized visualization rendering
